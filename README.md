# MongoDump-Cron

## Project Overview
This project automates MongoDB database dumps and sends notifications to Discord channels. It uses Bash shell scripts for scheduling and running dumps, processing dump logs and Curl for sending messages to Discord.

## Prerequisites
Before using this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **MongoDB** (for `mongodump` utility)
- **CronTab** (for scheduling cron jobs)
- **jq** (for proper escaping Curl JSON payload)

## File Summary

- `cron.sh` : Bash script for scheduling and running MongoDB dumps via cron jobs.
- `cron_query.sh` : Bash script for running MongoDB dumps with query filters and logging the last run time.
- `run_last_dump.sh` : Bash script for processing previous dump dates and managing dump history.
- `mongodump-last-run.txt` : Stores the last run date/time of the dump (auto-managed by scripts).
- `/mongodump-output-query` : Output folder for dump logs and results.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
2. Enter following credentials to ~/.bashrc:
    - MongoDB database URL
    - Discord Success/Failed Channel ID
3. Ensure MongoDB and `mongodump` are installed and accessible in your environment.
4. Set up your cron jobs to execute the shell scripts as needed.

## Usage
- Use the provided shell scripts to automate MongoDB dumps and notifications.
- Check the output logs and Discord channels for dump status updates.

## Notes
- Make sure your scripts have execute permissions (`chmod +x script.sh`).
- Review and adjust the scripts for your specific MongoDB URI, database, and collection names.
